ChatElevate - Boosting User Interactions with Smart AI
ChatElevate is an advanced AI-driven chatbot platform that delivers intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries. Built on the MERN stack and integrated with the Gemini API, ChatElevate ensures a seamless and responsive user experience, making interactions more engaging and effective.

Architecture
ChatElevate is constructed using the following technologies:

MongoDB: Stores user data, chat histories, and session information.
Express.js: Manages server-side logic and API endpoints, including secure user authentication.
React.js: Powers the dynamic and responsive user interface, providing an intuitive and interactive experience.
Node.js: Facilitates efficient communication between the frontend and backend, enabling real-time response generation.
The project follows a modular architecture, with dedicated components for user authentication, chat management, and API interaction. JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure authentication, and OTP verification is implemented via email to ensure user identity verification. Axios handles API communication, while Tailwind CSS provides a modern and responsive design.

Features

Real-Time Processing: The Gemini API provides accurate and relevant answers to user questions in real-time.
Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS ensures that the chatbot interface is fully responsive, offering a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.
